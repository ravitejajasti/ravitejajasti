# Hi, I'm Ravi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data scientist passionate about building machine learning models for transforming tomorrow. Today. I have worked in the areas of marketing, finance and supply chain to create machine learning models that use data and statistical evidence for business strategy optimization.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm an MS in Data Science student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I have experience in building and deploying machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Furthermore, I completed courses such as Python for Data Science (by Datacamp) and Azure Data Scientist (by Microsoft) and Alteryx.

I have spent more than 300 hours of additional coursework in learning, and these courses were influential in my theoretical understanding of machine learning, NLP, and data science. Later, I began to work on projects ranging from marketng, finance, retail and automobile industries. This portfolio is created to demonstrate a wide range of skills that I possess in solving and tackling machine learning problems. Thanks.ðŸ™‚
