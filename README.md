# Hi, I'm Venkat Ravi Teja Jasti! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Full stack developer and dat science (AI/ML) graduate passionate about transforming tomorrow today. I worked in the industries such as Energy Trading, Software, marketing working with stakeholders, understanding the business requirements and converting those requirements to business applications using technologies such as AWS/Azure/Heroku, Terraform and Python (DJANGO, DASH, Plotly, NLTK, SciPy) and maintaining them.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm an alumni of The University of Texas at Dallas. I have experience in building and deploying machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Furthermore, I completed courses such as Python for Data Science (by Datacamp) and Azure Data Scientist (by Microsoft) and Alteryx ETL.

I have spent more than 200 hours of additional coursework in learning, and these courses were influential in my theoretical understanding of machine learning, NLP, and data science. Later, I began to work on projects ranging from marketng, finance, retail and automobile industries. This portfolio is created to demonstrate a wide range of skills that I possess in solving and tackling machine learning problems. Thanks.ðŸ™‚
