# Hi, I'm Venkat! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full stack Engineer, AWS Solutions Architect and a data science (AI/ML) graduate passionate about transforming tomorrow today. I worked in the industries such as Energy Trading, Software, marketing collaborating with stakeholders, understanding the business requirements and converting those requirements to business applications using technologies such as Kubernetes, AWS/Azure/Heroku, Terraform and Python (DJANGO, DASH, Plotly, NLTK, SciPy) and maintaining them.


## ðŸš€ About Me
My journey in software development began with a curiosity about how code transforms into dynamic and visual designs. I started with HTML and CSS to design email templates and static web pages. Eventually, I learnt Python and its popular frameworks such as DJANGO, Flask, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Zeep, NLP/ML - NLTK, pyTorch, Sci-kit Learn etc. I have used these packages/frameworks to automate repetitive tasks, interact with SOAP/Rest APIs, built custom python packages and projects like the ones mentioned below. 

### Current Projects
1. GEN AI Agents - Architecture Design, FASTAPI, EC2, ReactJs, OpenSearch RAG, LLM Gateway, Kube Clusters, Langchain, LLM Finetuning, DynamoDB
2. Lead, maintain and support applications that communicate with Power Grids such as ERCOT/PJM - SOAP API, DASH, AWS Lambdas

### Web Applications
1. Plant Nursery Ecommerce application  - HEROKU CLOUD/ AWS ElasticBeanstalk, DJANGO
2. Azency Task Management system & Chat - LLMs, HTML/CSS/JS, AJAX, DJANGO, DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK
3. Bizfile - DJANGO and ReactJs (Intermediate)

I'm an **alumni of The University of Texas at Dallas with a Masters in Business Analytics (Data Science Track)**. During my masters, NLP/ML and Big Data courses have piqued my interest. I have spent more than 200 hours of additional coursework in learning, and these courses were influential in my theoretical understanding of machine learning, NLP, and data science. Later, I worked on Kaggle datasets/projects ranging from marketing, finance, retail and automobile industries to build and deploy machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. This portfolio is created to demonstrate a wide range of skills that I possess in solving and tackling Full stack development and machine learning problems. Thanks.ðŸ™‚
